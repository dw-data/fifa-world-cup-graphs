This repository contains the link to the database, the individual analyses and code for each graph. The graphs that show different trends since the beginning of the World Cup in 1930.

Idea, research, analysis, visualization: Julia Merk

## Database

The database for the Analysis is the [Fjelstul World Cup Database](https://github.com/jfjelstul/worldcup) by Joshua C. Fjelstul, Ph.D.. 

## Analysis

Here, you can find the analysis and the Python code for each chart. Most charts were created in Python and exported as svg to then be finalized.
